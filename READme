# This script creates a new GitHub repository using the GitHub API (via curl)
# and initializes a local Git repository with a README.md, then pushes it.

# --- Prerequisites ---
# To use this script, ensure you have the following installed and configured:
# 1. Git: Command-line version control system.
#    (Check with: `git --version`)
# 2. jq: A lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.
#    This is used to parse responses from the GitHub API.
#    (Install example: `sudo apt-get install jq` on Debian/Ubuntu, `brew install jq` on macOS)
#    (Check with: `jq --version`)
# 3. GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT):
#    You need a PAT with 'repo' scope (full control of private repositories).
#    Generate one here: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
#    For security and convenience, it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to set this as an environment variable:
#    export GITHUB_PAT="your_personal_access_token_here"
#    You can add the above line to your shell's configuration file (e.g., ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
#    to make it persistent across terminal sessions.
